In this phase, I aim to improve on the 2-D ground truth model such that it produces trajectories that more accurately resemble projectile motion as well as implement feedback from my supervisor.



PROGRESS:

1) Trajectories have improved. Simulate 2-D projectiles much better
2) Implemented feedback from my supervisor. All final position nodes are latent in both the Ground truth and the learned model.

In the next phase, I will ensure that the learned model is working properly and run different experiments with it.
