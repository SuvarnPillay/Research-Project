This is my research

Steps:

1) Generate basic trajectories using physics equation
2) Create model that learns to intercept the trajectory
    - Model input is point of the projectile
    - Model output is an action to move the interceptor

LIMITATIONS
- May need to remove the continuous structure of the data and discretize it. -> Lower accuracies should incur from this
