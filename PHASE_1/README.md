In this phase, only the most basic scenario is considered:
1) Launch velocities
2) Launch angles
3) Everything is done at the same time


This presents the following solutions in 2-D where only initial velocities and launch angles are varied. No additional variables are applied:
1) Trajectory generation
2) Pure physics projectile interception
3) Dynamic Bayesian Network Interception 


Additions for future phases could be:
1) Time variant - interceptor can be launched at different times depending on detection distance
2) Addition of drag
3) Addition of wind 
4) Control inputs for interceptor
5) 3-D solution
