In this phase, I will ensure that the learned model is working properly and run different experiments with it. I also need to figure out how I will train without perfect information (how do I structure the cpds for the model)

I aim to run the following experiments after fixing the model:

1) Train and test with perfect information. 
2) Train and test with missing final positions
